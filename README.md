# NumPy Practice ðŸ§®

This repository contains my personal practice notebooks as I learn and explore **NumPy**, the powerful library for numerical computing in Python.

All code is written and run in **Google Colab**, and the focus is on understanding both the **core concepts** and **practical use** of NumPy arrays.

## âœ… Topics Covered So Far

### 1. Lists vs NumPy Arrays
- Performance comparison
- Memory efficiency
- Syntax and usage differences

### 2. Creating Arrays from Scratch
- `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.full()`, `np.arange()`
- Random arrays: `np.random.rand()`

### 3. Understanding Dimensions
- **Vectors** (1D arrays)
- **Matrices** (2D arrays)
- **Tensors** (3D+ arrays)

### 4. Array Properties
- Shape, size, data type (`.shape`, `.ndim`, `.dtype`)
- Mutability and fixed type nature of arrays

## ðŸš€ My Learning Goal

To build a strong foundation in NumPy for future use in data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.
